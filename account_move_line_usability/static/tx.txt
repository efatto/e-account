Hi,

I was facing this problem and I finally found the solution to customize a column in TREE view, only for ONE view ;

Solution 1 that doesn't work :

    xml <field width="200" /> or <field style="width: 200" /> or <field style="width: 30 %%" />

--> width attribute doesn't seem to work in tree view ;

Solution 2 that doesn't work :

    xml <field class="my_class" /> ;
    css .my_class { width: 1000px;}

--> class attribute doesn't seem to work in tree view ;

Solution 3 that doesn't work :

    xml : <field name="my_field" />
    css : [data-id="my_field"]{width: 1000px;}

--> this works for ALL the column named "my_field". Not very good if we want to change the render of a column if the field is "name" ;

The workaround I found

    xml : <tree string="Tree String" version="7.0" class="my_class"> <field name="my_field" />
    css : .my_class [data-id="my_field"]{width: 1000px;}

--> class attribute works on tree tag.

-->To be sure to target only the desired view the name of my class is "myModuleName__myTreeViewName"

Thanks for your feedback.
